# TODO: Fix Authentication Key Inconsistency

## Information Gathered
- Dashboard.jsx and DriverManagement.jsx use `localStorage.getItem('currentUser')` directly, while auth.js uses 'rt_user' as the key.
- TruckManagement.jsx correctly uses `getCurrentUser()` from auth.js.
- This inconsistency causes `user` to be undefined, leading to "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'includes')" errors.

## Plan
- Update Dashboard.jsx to import and use `getCurrentUser()` from auth.js, and update localStorage.setItem to use 'rt_user'.
- Update DriverManagement.jsx similarly.
- TruckManagement.jsx is already correct.

## Dependent Files to be edited
- client/src/user/truck owners/dashboard/Dashboard.jsx
- client/src/user/truck owners/dashboard/DriverManagement.jsx

## Followup steps
- Test the application to ensure authentication works correctly.
- Verify that dashboard stats, drivers, and trucks load without errors.
